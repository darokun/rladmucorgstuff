#### 2. Sponsors' status:

Sponsor       | Status
--------------|---------------------------------------------------
[R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) | Pamela already filled out the application. We're waiting for their response.
[Stylight](https://www.stylight.com/About/Contact/) | They offered us hosting events. Daloha is asking about the last details.
[Münchner R Kurse](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/) | The webpage does not exist. We could not contact them
[Lehre@LMU](http://www.uni-muenchen.de/studium/lehre_at_lmu/index.html) | Daloha sent them an email on 31.03.2017. Waiting for response
[Wayra](http://wayra.co/en/) | Pamela contacted them about the venue, and they're also interested in hosting our events. Pamela is asking about the last details.

#### 3. Decide on a date for our first meetup event: 
April 26th, 2017 / 18:30 - 21:30 / Venue pending. 
Do not announce the event on meetup until we have decided on the venue.
  
#### 4. Brainstorm ideas for first meetup topic:
* **Social get-together**: Not our best idea. We believe most of the members will be eager to start doing R things, so we'd like to go for a workshop or tutorial.
* **Github + Rmarkdown**: Daloha will prepare a short tutorial on Github and Rmarkdown. She will work on the presentation and learning strategies next week, and will have it ready by the next meeting. It'd be nice to get name tag stickers ["HELLO MY NAME IS"](https://www.amazon.de/Aufkleber-Namensschilder-Hello-ohne-Rolle/dp/B0124GOZKS/ref=pd_sbs_21_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=HVQ4ZSQPBHNZP4K1BWP6).
* **The rough outline of the session is as follows**:

Time          | Activity
--------------|--------------------------------------
18:30 - 18:45 | Socializing, meet & greet
18:45 - 19:00 | Welcome presentation: who are we and why did we found R-Ladies Munich?
19:00 - 19:30 | Crash course Github (+ RStudio)
