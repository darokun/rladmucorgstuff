### Summary

1. We set up a new master password for our email account munich@rladies.org, so that all of us can remember it and have access to it.

2. We set up the [meetup group](www.meetup.com/rladies-munich) using the munich email and the master password.

  *  **About the meetup fee**: Daro paid the initial 6-month fee. We decided not to split the money just yet, but to ask for the R-Consortium grant to cover the expenses of the meetup fee.
  
  *  **About the meetup information**: We started with a short description found in the [R-Ladies Austin](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/) meetup group. The plan is to improve it in the following days, and also include some info in German taken from the [R-Ladies Berlin](www.meetup.com/rladies-berlin) group (Daro checked with them and they are totally okay with it).
  
4. We set up the [twitter](www.twitter.com/RLadiesMunich) account, using the same info.

5. We set up an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rladiesmunich/) account, using the same info.

6. We ran an initial survey on the three of us. The survey was taken and modified from [R-Ladies DC](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/), who at the same time took it from [R-Ladies Nashville](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-nashville/). The original survey can be found [here](https://kellyo.typeform.com/to/inkRZz), and our modified survey can be found [here](https://rladiesmunich.typeform.com/to/c46YCG).
